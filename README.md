Project Summary: 
FedEx Delivery History Analysis Using EDA and Data Visualization
This project, titled "FedEx", focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on SCMS delivery history data using Google Colab. The primary goal of the analysis was to understand the key patterns and relationships between different variables that influence the shipment and delivery performance of FedEx. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Plotly, a total of 15 interactive and static visualizations were created to uncover business insights and support data-driven decision-making.

The dataset includes fields such as delivery dates, shipment modes, freight costs, product classifications, weight, vendor details, and financial metrics like line item value and insurance. Initially, the data underwent cleaning and preprocessing, including the conversion of relevant columns to numeric formats and handling of missing or inconsistent values (e.g., "Weight Captured Separately"). This step ensured that the dataset was ready for meaningful statistical analysis and visualization.

Among the visualizations created, a Pair Plot played a crucial role in identifying correlations and patterns among multiple numeric variables such as Line Item Quantity, Value, Pack Price, Unit Price, Freight Cost, and Weight. The pair plot helped visually assess which variables move together and identify potential outliers. For instance, a positive correlation was observed between Line Item Quantity and Line Item Value, which confirms that larger shipments typically bring higher value. Similarly, Freight Cost increased with Weight, highlighting the direct relationship between package weight and shipping cost.

Another significant visualization was the Correlation Heatmap, which numerically and visually represented the strength of relationships between variables. This allowed easy identification of strongly and weakly correlated features, aiding in understanding operational dependencies.

Visual storytelling using bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and distribution plots further revealed trends such as the most used shipment modes, most frequent vendors, top product categories, and delivery timelines. Time-series visualizations also revealed seasonal or time-bound patterns in delivery delays and costs.

These insights carry positive business implications. For example, by identifying products or vendors associated with high freight costs or delays, the logistics team can take targeted actions such as negotiating better terms, optimizing shipment routes, or reconsidering vendor relationships. Additionally, aligning the pricing strategy by understanding pack and unit price correlations ensures accurate cost estimations and profitability.

On the other hand, certain findings highlighted areas of potential negative growth, such as high freight costs for low-value shipments or inconsistent insurance costs. These trends suggest inefficiencies that could reduce margins if left unaddressed. The analysis thus encourages proactive intervention to minimize waste and maximize operational efficiency.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the power of EDA and data visualization in extracting actionable insights from complex delivery data. It not only supports better logistical planning and vendor management but also drives strategic decisions to enhance overall business performance. Through thoughtful storytelling and visual experimentation, this analysis provides a strong foundation for continuous improvement in FedEx's delivery operations.
